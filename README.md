# Smolbot-nator
*A 2-day project*
*The plan was to create a facerig-like avatar to use for educational videos. Unfortunately that project didn't go anywhere, but I still ended up with this cute avatar*
*It's also usable as a virtual webcam for when I want to scare people on discord to death*

## Dependencies
*A lot of obscure ones, such as pyvirtualcam, but mostly Pillow and OpenCV (cv2 for short)*
